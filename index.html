              tourists. Every Hawaiian Island has its own draw, making this
              state one that is filled with adventure and luxury no matter which

          <h3 class="text-center">Eight Main Islands</h3>
          <p>
            There are eight main Hawaiian islands. Seven are inhabited, but only
            six are open to tourists and locals. Ni'ihau is privately managed,
            and access is restricted to those who have permission. This island
            is also home to native Hawaiians. Access to uninhabited Kaho'olawe
            island is also restricted and may be dangerous since it was a
            military base during the world wars and could still have unexploded
            ordnance.

                <p>
                  The island of Hawai'i is the youngest and largest island in
                  the Hawaiian chain. Nearly twice as big as all of the other
                  Hawaiian Islands combined (hence, its nickname, “Big Island”),
                  its sheer size is awe-inspiring.

                <p>
                  Maui, known also as “The Valley Isle,” is the second largest
                  Hawaiian island. The island beloved for its world-famous
                  beaches, the sacred 'Īao Valley, views of migrating humpback
                  whales (during winter months), farm-to-table cuisine and the
                  magnificent sunrise and sunset from Haleakalā.

                  Sometimes called “The Gathering Place,” O'ahu certainly lives
                  up to its name. The third largest Hawaiian island is home to
                  the majority of Hawai'i's diverse population, a fusion of East
                  and West cultures rooted in the values and traditions of the
                  Native Hawaiian people.

                <p>
                  Kaua'i is Hawai'i's fourth largest island and is sometimes
                  called the "Garden Island," which is an entirely accurate
                  description. The oldest and northernmost island in the
                  Hawaiian chain is draped in emerald valleys, sharp mountain
                  spires and jagged cliffs aged by time and the elements.

                  Hawai'i's fifth largest island, Moloka'i is only 38 miles long
                  and 10 miles across at its widest point and is home to the
                  highest sea cliffs in the world and the longest continuous
                  fringing reef.

                  The smallest inhabited island travelers may visit in Hawai'i,
                  Lāna'i offers big enticements to its visitors. Only nine miles
                  from Maui yet a world away, Lāna'i can feel like two places.
                  The first is found in luxurious resorts and the other is found
                  bouncing along the island's rugged back roads.
